    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>6 Large eggs</li>
        <li>3 cups Whole Milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large heavy saucepan, cook 3/4 cup of sugar over low heat, constantly and gently stirring with a whisk or silicone spatula, until melted and golden. Immediately pour the syrup into eight 6-ounce custard cups, dividing it evenly and tilting to coat the bottom of each cup. Let stand for 10 minutes to cool and firm slightly. Editor's Tip: Keep a close eye on the sugar as you stir it gently, even in the initial minutes. This prevents burning as the sugar gradually changes color and moves from tasting neutral to toasted to smoky. Don't test this while it's piping hot—rely on what the caramel stages look like. Residual heat will keep darkening the syrup, so pour it out as soon as it reaches your preferred hue.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the eggs, milk, vanilla and the remaining 3/4 cup of sugar with a whisk until blended but not foamy. Pour over the caramel, dividing the mixture evenly between the cups. Editor's Tip: Transfer the custard mixture to a large liquid measuring cup to help pour it evenly into the ramekins.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Arrange the cups in two 8x8-inch baking pans. Carefully pour very hot water into the pans and around the cups to a depth of 1 inch, making sure it doesn't splash onto the custard. Gently put the pans in a 350°F oven. Editor's Tip: It's important to smoothly slide the pans into the oven so the water doesn't spill. Once in the oven (the middle rack is preferred), shift the cups so they don't touch one another or the pan's sides.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Bake the custard until a knife inserted in the center of a cup comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Editor's Tip: Use the oven light to check that the water has not completely evaporated. When the custard is done in the center but still jiggling slightly, remove the cups from the pans and set them on wire racks to cool.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>To unmold the custard, run a knife around the inside of the rim of each cup. Place a small plate upside down on top of the cup and flip them together, inverting the custard and its sauce onto the plate; if the custard clings to the baking dish, shake gently before lifting the cup straight off the plate. Serve warm or cold. Editor's Tip: If you find it difficult to unmold warm custard, you can eat it straight from the cup, with the caramel at the bottom. It can be easier to neatly invert the custard servings if you put the cups in the refrigerator for at least one hour after they have cooled at room temperature</li>
